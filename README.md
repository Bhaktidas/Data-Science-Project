# Project Name: Unmessenger Internship Project




## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to predict the employee turnover rate, which can help save the company from loss. The project is divided into four tasks.
## Tasks
1.  Predictive modeling: Using data science and predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to predict the employee turnover rate accurately.

2. Feature engineering: The raw data is transformed into features that can be used for supervised learning. This task includes selecting, manipulating, and transforming the raw data into numerical values to enhance the model's performance.

3. Feature selection: The task is to select the most important variables that significantly impact the prediction model's output and eliminate irrelevant or redundant features to improve the prediction power of the machine learning algorithm.

4. Ensemble modeling: The task aims to combine multiple models, known as base estimators, using machine learning approaches to overcome the technical challenges of building a single estimator.
## Tasks Overview
1. Predictive Modeling
The first task of the project is to predict the employee turnover rate by leveraging data science and predictive modeling techniques. The output of this task is a prediction model that can accurately predict employee turnover.

2. Feature Engineering
The second task of the project is to transform the raw data into features that can be used for supervised learning. The process includes selecting, manipulating, and transforming the raw data into numerical values, such as converting character values into numerical values, to improve the model's performance.

3. Feature Selection
The third task of the project is to select the most important variables and eliminate irrelevant or redundant features to improve the prediction power of the machine learning algorithm. This process aims to enhance the model's performance and reduce the complexity of the model.

4. Ensemble Modeling
The fourth task of the project is to combine multiple models, known as base estimators, using machine learning approaches to overcome the technical challenges of building a single estimator. The process aims to improve the model's performance and provide a more accurate prediction of employee turnover.

## Conclusion
This project aims to help the company save costs by predicting which employees are more likely to leave the company. The project will involve data analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and building ensemble models. The end result will be a model that can accurately predict employee turnover rate and help the company take proactive measures to retain its employees.
